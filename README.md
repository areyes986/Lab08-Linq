#### Application
![All neighborhoods](./assets/all.png)  
Here we see that all neighborhoods are populated but not distinctly, there are still duplicates and still populates neighborhoods with no names  


![Duplicates](./assets/distinct.png)
Now it is populating all of the non duplicated neighborhoods that have names using a lambda method.
